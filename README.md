# TryHackMe

This repo contains 'writeups' for the rooms I have completed om TryHackMe. <br>
Writeups is in quotes because these are ugly. Doesn't contain screenshots, but just some text. <br>
<br>

<h3>Edited:<br>
I went through the uploaded files and noticed that many of them have just the scan results :/<br>
But now I have started writing good writeups. They now include screenshots as well. <br>

<br>

<h2>But what's best in this is that I have learnt over the time that how to write good writeups and I'm learning from my mistakes.</h2>
<br>
<h1>KEEP LEARNING. KEEP PROGRESSING ✌️</h1>
